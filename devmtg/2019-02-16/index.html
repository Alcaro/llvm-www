  We invite speakers from academia and industry to present their work on the
  following list of topics (including and not limited to:)
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compilation and interpretation techniques benefitting from LLVM,</li>
    <li>Classical performance and code-size optimizations using LLVM,</li>
    <li>Improvements to runtime libraries developed under llvm-infrastructure
      e.g., libc++, libc++-abi,</li>
    <li>Improving the security of generated code using compilation
      techniques,</li>
    <li>Any tools developed with LLVM (or subprojects) for performance
      analysis,</li>
    <li>compiler flags, annotations and remarks to understand and improve
      performance,</li>
    <li>any other topic related to improving and maintaining the performance and
      quality of LLVM generated code.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  While the primary focus of the workshop is on these topics, we welcome any
  submission related to the LLVM compiler infrastructure, its sub-projects
  (clang, lldb, Polly, ...), as well as its use in industry and academia.

  <li>tutorials,</li>
  <li>BOFs.</li>
</ul>

  Proposals should provide enough information for the review committee to be
  able to judge the quality of the submission. Proposals can be submitted under
  the form of an extended abstract, full paper, or slides.  Proposals should be
  submitted to
  <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=llvmcgo2019">Easychair
