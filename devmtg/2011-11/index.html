<p>We are eager to find companies to help cover travel expenses for speakers needing assistance. If your company is interested, please contact dkipping@qualcomm.com.</p>

<p>The meeting serves as a forum for <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>,
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>, <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> and 
other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and 
exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we
believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel 
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also invite you to sign up for the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting">official Developer Meeting mailing list</a> to be kept informed of updates concerning the meeting.

The attendance limit has been increased to 225 this year, but with the growing interest in LLVM, registration will likely still fill up quickly; we encourage you to register early.
