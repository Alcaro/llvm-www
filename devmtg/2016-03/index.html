<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>
<p>
The LLVM Foundation announces the sixth annual European LLVM Developers' Meeting
will be held March 17th and 18th in Barcelona, Spain.
</p>

<p>
This year, the conference will be collocated with <a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2016/">CGO</a>
and <a href="http://cc2016.eew.technion.ac.il/">CC</a>, enabling collaboration and
exchange of ideas with the research community.
</p>

<p>
The conference will be 2 full days that include technical talks, BoFs, hackerâ€™s lab,
tutorials, and a poster session.
</p>

<p>
The meeting serves as a forum for <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>,
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>, <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> and 
other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and 
exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we
believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel 
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please sign up for the
<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting">LLVM Developers' Meeting list</a>
for future announcements and to ask questions. 
</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="CFP">Call for Paper</div>

<p>
We invite academic, industrial and hobbyist speakers to present their work on
developing or using LLVM, Clang, etc. Proposals for technical presentations,
posters, workshops, demonstrations and BoFs are welcome. Material will be chosen
to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics at various depths, some technical
deep-diving, some more community focused.
</p>

<p>
We are looking for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote speakers.</li>
<li>Technical presentations (30 minutes plus questions and discussion) related to the
  development of LLVM, Clang, LLD, LLDB, Polly, ...</li>
<li>Presentations relating to academic or commercial use of LLVM, Clang etc.</li>
<li>Lightning talks (5 minutes, no questions, no discussion).</li>
<li>Workshops and in-depth tutorials (1-2 hours - please specify in your submission).</li>
<li>Poster presentations.</li>
<li>Birds of a Feather sessions (BoFs).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The deadline for receiving submissions is <del>January 25, 2016</del> <ins>January 29, 2016</ins>.
</p>

<p>
Submissions should be done using the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eurollvm2016"> Easychair</a> platform.
</p>

<p>
Please note that presentation materials and videos for the technical sessions
will be posted on llvm.org after the conference. We have reserved additional
spots for speakers, such that they can attend the conference even though we
have reached our registration limit.
</p>

<p>
In terms of submission style, we are looking for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A title and an extended abstract,</li>
</ul>
<p>
            OR
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A title, abstract and slides.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please make clear the status of the slides (are they a skeleton of your
presentation with the detail missing ?), or, perhaps a section of detail that
lacks introduction and conclusions?  Also make sure to give enough information
in the extended abstract: the more you can give us and tell us the easier it
will be for us to be positive about your submission. 
</p>

<p>
Proposals that are not sufficiently detailed (talks lacking a comprehensive
abstract for example) are likely to be rejected. Slides and posters must be
in PDF format.
</p>

<p>
The call for paper is over since January 29, 2016.
</p>

<p>
The program committee is now working hard at reviewing all submissions.
</p>

<p>
The program committee attempts to reflects the diversity of our community.
It consists of David Chisnall, Sanjoy Das, Tobias Edler von Koch,
Arnaud de Grandmaison, Hal Finkel, Renato Golin, Tobias Grosser,
Tanya Lattner, David Majnemer, James Molloy, Adam Nemet.
</p>

<p>
Speakers will be notified of acceptance or rejection by February 15th, 2016.

</p>

<p>
Hotel discounts are available via the above registration link.
</p>

<p>
The registration rate is 200&euro; (student: 80&euro;). Note that some credit
card companies run a fraud prevention check and reject the payment. We have seen 
this happening for a few people, mostly from the US. Should this happen to you, 
please get in touch with <a href="mailto:sdimartino@pacifico-meetings.com">Sara Di Martino</a>
and ask her to sort out the problem for you.
</p>

<!--p>
There was an early registration rate until Feb 3rd, 2016: 150&euro; (student: 80&euro;).

<p>
<b><a id="tuto1">Adding your Architecture to LLDB</a></b><br>
<i>Deepak Panickal - Codeplay</i><br>
<i>Andrzej Warzynski - Codeplay</i><br>
This tutorial explains how to get started with adding a new architecture to
LLDB. It walks through all the major steps required and how LLDB's various
plugins work together in making this a maintainable and easily approachable
task. It will cover: basic definition of the architecture, implementing
register read/write through adding a RegisterContext, manipulating breakpoints,
single-stepping, adding an ABI for stack walking, adding support for
disassembly of the architecture, memory read/write through modifying Process
plugins, and everything else that is needed in order to provide a usable
debugging experience. The required steps will be demonstrated for a RISC
architecture not yet supported in LLDB, but simple enough so that no expert
knowledge of the underlying target is required. Practical debugging tips, as
well as solutions to common issues, will be given.
</p>

<p>
<b><a id="tuto2">Analyzing and Optimizing your Loops with Polly</a></b><br>
<i>Tobias Grosser - ETH</i><br>
<i>Johannes Doerfert - Saarland University</i><br>
<i>Zino Benaissa - Quic Inc.</i><br>
The Polly Loop Optimizer is a framework for the analysis and optimization of
(possibly imperfectly) nested loops. It provides various transformations such
as loop fusion, loop distribution, loop tiling as well as outer loop
vectorization. In this tutorial we introduce the audience to the Polly loop
optimizer and show how Polly can be used to analyze and improve the performance
of their code. We start off with basic questions such as "Did Polly understand
my loops?", "What information did Polly gather?", "How does the optimized loop
nest look like?", "Can I provide more information to enable better
optimizations?", and "How can I utilize Polly's analysis for other purposes?".
Starting from these foundations we continue with a deeper look in more advanced
uses of Polly: This includes the analysis and optimization of some larger
benchmarks, the programming interfaces to Polly as well as the connection
between Polly and other LLVM-IR passes. At the end of this tutorial we expect
the audience to not only be able to optimize their codes with Polly, but also
to have a first understanding of how to use it as a framework to implement
their own loop transformations.
</p>

<p>
<b><a id="tuto3">Building, Testing and Debugging a Simple out-of-tree LLVM Pass</a></b><br>
<i>Serge Guelton - Quarkslab</i><br>
<i>Adrien Guinet - Quarkslab</i><br>
This tutorial aims at providing solid ground to develop out-of-tree LLVM passes.
It presents all the required building blocks, starting from scratch: cmake
integration, llvm pass management, opt / clang integration. It presents the core
IR concepts through two simple obfuscating passes: the SSA form, the CFG, PHI
nodes, IRBuilder etc. We also take a quick tour on analysis integration through
dominators. Finally, it showcases how to use cl and lit to parametrize and test
the toy passes developed in the tutorial.
