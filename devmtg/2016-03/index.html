<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>
<p>
The LLVM Foundation announces the sixth annual European LLVM Developers' Meeting
will be held March 17th and 18th in Barcelona, Spain.
</p>

<p>
This year, the conference will be collocated with <a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2016/">CGO</a>
and <a href="http://cc2016.eew.technion.ac.il/">CC</a>, enabling collaboration and
exchange of ideas with the research community.
</p>

<p>
The conference will be 2 full days that include technical talks, BoFs, hackerâ€™s lab,
tutorials, and a poster session.
</p>

<p>
The meeting serves as a forum for <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>,
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>, <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> and 
other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and 
exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we
believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel 
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please sign up for the
<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting">LLVM Developers' Meeting list</a>
for future announcements and to ask questions. 
</p>

<p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="CFP">Call for Paper</div>

<p>
We invite academic, industrial and hobbyist speakers to present their work on
developing or using LLVM, Clang, etc. Proposals for technical presentations,
posters, workshops, demonstrations and BoFs are welcome. Material will be chosen
to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics at various depths, some technical
deep-diving, some more community focused.
</p>

<p>
We are looking for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote speakers.</li>
<li>Technical presentations (30 minutes plus questions and discussion) related to the
  development of LLVM, Clang, LLD, LLDB, Polly, ...</li>
<li>Presentations relating to academic or commercial use of LLVM, Clang etc.</li>
<li>Lightning talks (5 minutes, no questions, no discussion).</li>
<li>Workshops and in-depth tutorials (1-2 hours - please specify in your submission).</li>
<li>Poster presentations.</li>
<li>Birds of a Feather sessions (BoFs).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The deadline for receiving submissions is January 25, 2016. 
</p>

<p>
Speakers will be notified of acceptance or rejection by February 15th, 2016.
</p>

<p>
Submissions should be done using the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eurollvm2016"> Easychair</a> platform.
</p>

<p>
Please note that presentation materials and videos for the technical sessions
will be posted on llvm.org after the conference. We have reserved additional
spots for speakers, such that they can attend the conference even though we
have reached our registration limit.
</p>

<p>
In terms of submission style, we are looking for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A title and an extended abstract,</li>
</ul>
<p>
            OR
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A title, abstract and slides.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please make clear the status of the slides (are they a skeleton of your
presentation with the detail missing ?), or, perhaps a section of detail that
lacks introduction and conclusions?  Also make sure to give enough information
in the extended abstract: the more you can give us and tell us the easier it
will be for us to be positive about your submission. 
</p>

<p>
Proposals that are not sufficiently detailed (talks lacking a comprehensive
abstract for example) are likely to be rejected. Slides and posters must be
in PDF format.
</p>
