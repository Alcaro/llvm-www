<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>
<p>
The LLVM Foundation announces the sixth annual European LLVM Developers' Meeting
will be held March 17th and 18th in Barcelona, Spain.
</p>

<p>
This year, the conference will be collocated with <a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2016/">CGO</a>
and <a href="http://cc2016.eew.technion.ac.il/">CC</a>, enabling collaboration and
exchange of ideas with the research community.
</p>

<p>
The conference will be 2 full days that include technical talks, BoFs, hackerâ€™s lab,
tutorials, and a poster session.
</p>

<p>
The meeting serves as a forum for <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>,
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>, <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> and 
other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and 
exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we
believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel 
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please sign up for the
<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting">LLVM Developers' Meeting list</a>
for future announcements and to ask questions.

We invite academic, industrial and hobbyist speakers to present their work on
developing or using LLVM, Clang, etc. Proposals for technical presentations,
posters, workshops, demonstrations and BoFs are welcome. Material will be chosen
to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics at various depths, some technical
deep-diving, some more community focused.
</p>

<p>
We are looking for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Keynote speakers.</li>
<li>Technical presentations (30 minutes plus questions and discussion) related to the
  development of LLVM, Clang, LLD, LLDB, Polly, ...</li>
<li>Presentations relating to academic or commercial use of LLVM, Clang etc.</li>
<li>Lightning talks (5 minutes, no questions, no discussion).</li>
<li>Workshops and in-depth tutorials (1-2 hours - please specify in your submission).</li>
<li>Poster presentations.</li>
<li>Birds of a Feather sessions (BoFs).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The deadline for receiving submissions is <del>January 25, 2016</del> <ins>January 29, 2016</ins>.
</p>

<p>
Submissions should be done using the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eurollvm2016"> Easychair</a> platform.
</p>

<p>
Please note that presentation materials and videos for the technical sessions
will be posted on llvm.org after the conference. We have reserved additional
spots for speakers, such that they can attend the conference even though we
have reached our registration limit.
</p>

<p>
In terms of submission style, we are looking for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A title and an extended abstract,</li>
</ul>
<p>
            OR
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A title, abstract and slides.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please make clear the status of the slides (are they a skeleton of your
presentation with the detail missing ?), or, perhaps a section of detail that
lacks introduction and conclusions?  Also make sure to give enough information
in the extended abstract: the more you can give us and tell us the easier it
will be for us to be positive about your submission. 
</p>

<p>
Proposals that are not sufficiently detailed (talks lacking a comprehensive
abstract for example) are likely to be rejected. Slides and posters must be
in PDF format.
</p>

<p>
The call for paper is over since January 29, 2016.

<b><a id="tuto1">Adding your Architecture to LLDB</a></b><br>
<i>Deepak Panickal - Codeplay</i><br>
<i>Andrzej Warzynski - Codeplay</i><br>
This tutorial explains how to get started with adding a new architecture to
LLDB. It walks through all the major steps required and how LLDB's various
plugins work together in making this a maintainable and easily approachable
task. It will cover: basic definition of the architecture, implementing
register read/write through adding a RegisterContext, manipulating breakpoints,
single-stepping, adding an ABI for stack walking, adding support for
disassembly of the architecture, memory read/write through modifying Process
plugins, and everything else that is needed in order to provide a usable
debugging experience. The required steps will be demonstrated for a RISC
architecture not yet supported in LLDB, but simple enough so that no expert
knowledge of the underlying target is required. Practical debugging tips, as
well as solutions to common issues, will be given.
</p>

<p>
<b><a id="tuto2">Analyzing and Optimizing your Loops with Polly</a></b><br>
<i>Tobias Grosser - ETH</i><br>
<i>Johannes Doerfert - Saarland University</i><br>
<i>Zino Benaissa - Quic Inc.</i><br>
The Polly Loop Optimizer is a framework for the analysis and optimization of
(possibly imperfectly) nested loops. It provides various transformations such
as loop fusion, loop distribution, loop tiling as well as outer loop
vectorization. In this tutorial we introduce the audience to the Polly loop
optimizer and show how Polly can be used to analyze and improve the performance
of their code. We start off with basic questions such as "Did Polly understand
my loops?", "What information did Polly gather?", "How does the optimized loop
nest look like?", "Can I provide more information to enable better
optimizations?", and "How can I utilize Polly's analysis for other purposes?".
Starting from these foundations we continue with a deeper look in more advanced
uses of Polly: This includes the analysis and optimization of some larger
benchmarks, the programming interfaces to Polly as well as the connection
between Polly and other LLVM-IR passes. At the end of this tutorial we expect
the audience to not only be able to optimize their codes with Polly, but also
to have a first understanding of how to use it as a framework to implement
their own loop transformations.
</p>

<p>
<b><a id="tuto3">Building, Testing and Debugging a Simple out-of-tree LLVM Pass</a></b><br>
<i>Serge Guelton - Quarkslab</i><br>
<i>Adrien Guinet - Quarkslab</i><br>
This tutorial aims at providing solid ground to develop out-of-tree LLVM passes.
It presents all the required building blocks, starting from scratch: cmake
integration, llvm pass management, opt / clang integration. It presents the core
IR concepts through two simple obfuscating passes: the SSA form, the CFG, PHI
nodes, IRBuilder etc. We also take a quick tour on analysis integration through
dominators. Finally, it showcases how to use cl and lit to parametrize and test
the toy passes developed in the tutorial.
</p><p>
Note from the program committee: this was a succesful tutorial at the 2015 US
LLVM dev meeting, and we thought it made sense to have it again for a EuroLLVM
audience, especially when considering we are collocated with CGO and CC.

<b><a id="poster1">ARCHER: Effectively Spotting Data Races in Large OpenMP Applications</a></b><br>
<i>Simone Atzeni - University of Utah</i><br>
<i>Ganesh Gopalakrishnan - University of Utah</i><br>
<i>Zvonimir Rakamaric - University of Utah</i><br>
<i>Dong H. Ahn - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</i><br>
<i>Ignacio Laguna - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</i><br>
<i>Martin Schulz - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</i><br>
<i>Gregory L. Lee - Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</i><br>
Although the importance OpenMP as a parallel programming model and its adoption
in Clang/LLVM is increasing (OpenMP 3.1 is now fully supported by Clang/LLVM
3.7), existing data-race checkers for OpenMP have high overheads and generate
many false positives. In this work, we propose the first OpenMP data race
checker, ARCHER, that achieves high accuracy and low overheads on large OpenMP
applications. Built on top of LLVM/Clang and the ThreadSanitizer (TSan) dynamic
race checker, ARCHER incorporates scalable happens-before tracking, and
exploits structured parallelism via combined static and dynamic analysis, and
modularly interfaces with OpenMP runtimes. ARCHER significantly outperforms
TSan and Intel Inspector XE, while providing the same or better precision. It
has helped detect critical data races in the Hypre library that is central to
many projects at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and
elsewhere.

<b><a id="poster2">Design-space exploration of LLVM pass order with simulated annealing</a></b><br>
<i>Nicholas Timmons - Cambridge University</i><br>
<i>David Chisnall - Cambridge University</i><br>
We undertook an automated design space exploration of the optimisation pass
order and inliner thresholds in Clang using simulated annealing. It was
performed separately on multiple input programs so that the results could be
validated against each other. Superior configurations to the preset
optimisation levels were found, such as those which produce similar run times
to the presets whilst reducing build times, and those which offer improved
run-time performance than the '-O3' optimisation level. Contrary to our
expectation, we also found that the preset optimisation levels did not provide
a uniform distribution in the tradeoff space between run and build-time
performance.

<b><a id="poster3">ConSerner: Compiler Driven Context Switches between Accelerators and CPUs</a></b><br>
<i>Ramy Gad - Johannes Gutenberg University</i><br>
<i>Tim Suess - University of Mainz</i><br>
<i>Andre Brinkmann - Johannes Gutenberg-Universit&auml;t Mainz</i><br>
Computer systems provide different heterogeneous resources (e.g., GPUs, DSPs
and FPGAs) that accelerate applications and that can reduce the energy
consumption by using them. Usually, these resources have an isolated memory and
a require target specific code to be written. There exist tools that can
automatically generate target specific codes for program parts, so-called
kernels. The data objects required for a target kernel execution need to be
moved to the target resource memory. It is the programmers' responsibility to
serialize these data objects used in the kernel and to copy them to or from the
resource's memory. Typically, the programmer writes his own serializing
function or uses existing serialization libraries. Unfortunately, both
approaches require code modifications, and the programmer needs knowledge of
the used data structure format. There is a need for a tool that is able to
automatically extract the original kernel data objects, serialize them, and
migrate them to a target resource without requiring intervention from the
programmer.
</p><p>
In this work, we present a tool collection ConSerner that automatically
identifies, gathers, and serializes the context of a kernel and migrates it to
a target resource's memory where a target specific kernel is executed with this
data. This is all done transparently to the programmer. Complex data structures
can be used without making a modification of the program code by a programmer
necessary. Predefined data structures in external libraries (e.g., the STL's
vector) can also be used as long as the source code of these libraries is
available.

<b><a id="poster4">Evaluation of State-of-the-art Static Checkers for Detecting Objective-C Bugs in iOS Applications</a></b><br>
<i>Thai San Phan - University of New South Wales</i><br>
<i>Yulei Sui - University of New South Wales</i><br>
The pervasive usage of mobile phone applications is now changing the way
people use traditional software. Smartphone apps generated an impressive USD
35 billion in full-year 2014, and in total 138 billion apps were
downloaded in the year. The last few years have seen an unprecedented number
of people rushing to develop mobile apps. Apple iOS has always played a major
role in the smart-devices industry ever since the evolution of it. On average,
around 45,000 newly developed apps are submitted for release to the iTunes
App Store in 2014. Similar as desktop software, any mobile applications are
prone to bugs and it is difficult to completely make them bug-free. As a
fundamental tool to help programmers effectively locate program defects during
compile time, static analysis approximates the runtime behaviour of a program
without actually executing it. It is extremely helpful to catch bugs earlier during
software development cycle before the produced is shipped in order to avoid
high maintenance cost. This poster is hence to evaluate the state-of-the-art static
checkers for detecting Objective-C bugs to systematically investigate the
advantages and disadvantages of using different checkers on a wide variety bug
patterns in iOS applications.
</p><p>
Objective-C, as the primary language for iOS application, is an object-oriented
superset of C such that it inherits syntax, primitive types and flow control
statements of C. Though it has many new features that distinguish it from C
such as message passing (equivalent to C or Java's method calling), interface
and implementation for objects (equivalent to "class" in C++), garbage collector
or now ARC (C does not have this feature), and most importantly, it is a
runtime-driven language where decisions such as memory allocations, object
creation, reflection API are decided at runtime as oppose to be determined
during compilation. All these features significantly complicated scalable and
precise static analysis.

<b><a id="poster5">Stack Size Estimation on Machine-Independent Intermediate Code for OpenCL Kernels</a></b><br>
<i>Stefano Cherubin - Politecnico di Milano</i><br>
<i>Michele Scandale - Politecnico di Milano</i><br>
<i>Giovanni Agosta - Politecnico di Milano</i><br>
Stack size is an important factor in the mapping decision when dealing with
embedded heterogeneous architectures, where fast memory is a scarce resource.
Trying to map a kernel onto a device with insufficient memory may lead to
reduced performance or even failure to run the kernel. OpenCL kernels are
often compiled just-in-time, starting from the source code or an intermediate
machine-independent representation. Precise stack size information, however,
is only available in machine-dependent code. We provide a method for computing
the stack size with sufficient accuracy on machine-independent code, given
knowledge of the target ABI and register file architecture. This method can be
applied to make mapping decisions early, thus avoiding to compile multiple
times the code for each possible accelerator in a complex embedded
heterogeneous system. 
</p>

<b><a id="poster6">AAP: The Compiler Writer's Architecture from hell</a></b><br>
<i>Simon Cook - Embecosm</i><br>
<i>Edward Jones - Embecosm</i><br>
<i>Jeremy Bennett - Embecosm</i><br>
Contending with the blistering pace of LLVM advancement is a challenge for out
of tree targets. Many out of tree targets, often for widely used embedded
processors, have hardware features which are not well represented by the
mainstream LLVM project.
</p><p>
We introduced An Altruistic Processor (AAP) at EuroLLVM 2015. AAP's
architecture encapsulates as many of these features as possible. AAP is a
RISC, Harvard architecture with up to 64kB of byte addressed data, up to 16MW of
word addressed code, and a configurable register bank of between 4 and 64
registers.
</p><p>
In this poster we will present an update on the AAP architecture. We'll look
at some of the most challenging features, and how we have extended LLVM to
support them. This includes :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>different sizes of code and address pointers,</li>
  <li>how to handle code pointers that do not fit in the default address space,</li>
  <li>operations where stack access is cheaper than register access,</li>
  <li>how to relax call/return when you have multiple return address sizes.</li>
</ul>

<i>LLVM Foundation members</i><br>
This BoF will give the EuroLLVM attendees a chance to talk with some of the
board members of the LLVM Foundation. We will discuss the Code of Conduct and
Apache2 license proposal and answer any questions about the LLVM Foundation.

<b><a id="bof2">Compilers in Education</a></b><br>
<i>Roel Jordans - Eindhoven University of Technology</i><br>
<i>Henk Corporaal - Eindhoven University of Technology</i><br>
While computer architecture and hardware optimization is generally well covered
in education, compilers are still often a poorly represented subject. Classical
compiler lecture series seem to mostly cover the front-end parts of the
compiler but usually lack an in-depth discussion of newer optimization and code
generation techniques. Important aspects such as auto-vectorization, complex
instruction support for DSP architectures, and instruction scheduling for
highly parallel for VLIW architectures are often touched only lightly. However,
creating new processor designs requires a properly optimizing compiler in order
for it to be usable by your customers. As such, there is a good market for
well-trained compiler engineers which does not match with the classical style
of teaching compilers in education.
</p><p>
At Eindhoven University of Technology, we are currently starting a new compiler
course that should provide such an improved lecture series to our
students and we plan to make this available to the wider community. The
focus of this lecture series is on tool-flow organization of modern
parallelizing compilers, their internal techniques, and the advantages
and limitations of these techniques. We try to train the students so that
they can understand how the compiler works internally, but also apply
this new knowledge in writing C program code that allows the compiler to
utilize its advanced optimizations to generate better and portable code.
As a result, we hope to provide better qualified compiler engineers, but
also train them to write better high-performance code at a high-level by
applying their compiler knowledge in guiding the compiler to an efficient
implementation of the program.
</p><p>
As part this process we would like to get in contact with institutes and
companies that will be taking advantage of our newly educated students
and discuss with them the contents of our lecture series. What do you
guys think are important topics that new engineers should know about to
be useful in your organization and what would make this course
interesting for yourself?

<b><a id="bof3">Surviving Downstream</a></b><br>
<i>Paul Robinson - Sony Computer Entertainment America</i><br>
We presented "Living Downstream Without Drowning" as a tutorial/BOF
session at the US LLVM meeting in October. After the session, Paul
had people coming to talk to him for most of the evening social event
and half of the next day (and so missed several other talks!).
Clearly a lot of people are in this situation and there are many
good ideas to share.
</p><p>
Come to this follow-up BOF and share your practices, problems and
solutions for surviving the "flood" of changes from the upstream
LLVM projects.

<b><a id="bof4">Polly - Loop Optimization Infrastructure</a></b><br>
<i>Tobias Grosser - ETH</i><br>
<i>Johannes Doerfert - Saarland University</i><br>
<i>Zino Benaissa - Quic Inc.</i><br>
The Polly Loop Optimization infrastructure has seen active development
throughout 2015 with contributions from a larger group of developers located at
various places around the globe. With three successful Polly sessions at the US
developers meeting and larger interest at the recent HiPEAC conference in Prag,
we expect various Polly developers to be able to attend EuroLLVM. To facilitate
in-persona collaboration between the core developers and to reach out to the
wider loop optimization community, we propose a BoF session on Polly and the
LLVM loop optimization infrastructure. Current hot topics are the
usability of Polly in an '-O3' compiler pass sequence, profile driven
optimizations as well as the definition of future development milestones.
The Polly developers community will present ideas on these topics, but
very much invites input from interested attendees.

This Birds of a Feather session is intended to bring together
developers and users interested in LLVM on the two IBM platforms
PowerPC and SystemZ.
</p><p>
Topics for discussion include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Status of platform support in the two LLVM back ends: feature
       completeness, architecture support, performance, ...</li>
  <li> Platform support in other parts of the overall LLVM portfolio: LLD, LLDB, sanitizers, ...</li>
  <li> Support for new languages and other emerging use cases: Swift, Rust, Impala, ...</li>
  <li> Any other features currently in development for the platform(s)</li>
