<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="what">What is it?</div>
<p>
<a href="http://bloomberg.com/company/technology" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> is hosting a gathering of developers, students, and others from around
the Clang/LLVM community to spend a weekend learning how to work on Clang, LLVM, and other projects in the LLVM ecosystem. This event is intended to help
new community members get started learning how to contribute, how to work on the code, and get their first patches written and submitted.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg is providing the space, food, beverages, travel/lodging for mentors, and the organization of the event, so attendees only need to bring their 
laptops (with power adapters!) and a willingness to learn and contribute. At both locations there will be experienced mentors on hand to provide guidance.

Civic Hall is located at the intersection of 20th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. You'll enter through the <a href="civichallentrance.jpg" target="_blank">main entrance</a> on Fifth Avenue, then take either
the stairs (on your left) or the elevator bank (labeled East Elevators) on your right, to the second floor. If you have any questions or need assistance, the
security guard just inside the lobby will be happy to help you.
</p>
<p>
When you arrive at the second floor, there will be a check-in desk, so please stop there to ensure that we know you've arrived. You'll then be directed to the
<a href="civichallhackspace.jpg" target="_blank">hacking space</a>, where you can find a place to setup your laptop, and then head over to the kitchen to grab breakfast, coffee, juice, etc.
</p>
<p>
Note: If you arrive after 11AM, the check-in desk will no longer be present, so just enter through the main door to Civic Hall from the second floor landing, and check in
at the main Civic Hall reception counter.
</p>
<p>
On both days, breakfast and lunch will be provided; on Saturday, dinner will also be provided. Please review the <a href="newyorkmenu.html">menu</a> in advance, and if for any reason the options available
will not meet your requirements, let us know, but be prepared to make alternate arrangements for meals. There are a large number of places to obtain food (from delis to
sandwich shops to sit-down restaurants) in the area around Civic Hall, so you should be able to find something compatible.
