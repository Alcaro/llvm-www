</dd>

<dt><b>Student Research Competition</b> </dt>
<dd>Students present their research using LLVM or related subproject. These are usually 20 minute technical presentations with Q&A. The audence will vote at the end for the winning presentation and paper.</dd>

<dt><b>Poster Session</b></dt>
<dd>An hour long poster session where selected posted are on display.</dd>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="wictw">Women in Compilers and Tools Workshop</div>
<p>
The LLVM Foundation will host a half day Women in Compilers and Tools Workshop held the day before the 2019 LLVM Developers’ Meeting - Bay Area. The workshop will be held at the Fairmont Hotel on October 21st from 12:30-5:30PM and includes a cocktail reception.
</p>
<p>
This event aims to connect women in the field of compilers and tools and provide them with ideas and techniques to overcome barriers or enhance their careers. It also is open to anyone (not just women) who are interested in increasing diversity within the LLVM community, their workplace or university.
</p>
<p>
More details wil be coming soon but <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2019-llvm-foundations-women-in-compilers-and-tools-workshop-tickets-64471042624">registration is open</a>.
</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="cfp">Call for Presentations</div>
<p>
All developers and users of LLVM and related sub-projects are invited to present.
</p>
<p>
We are looking for the following proposals:
<ul>
<li>Technical Talks (25-30 minutes including Q&A):</li>
<ul><li>On LLVM Infrastructure, Clang and all related sub-projects</li>
<li>On uses of LLVM in academia or industry</li>
<li>On new projects using Clang or LLVM</li>
</ul>
<li>Tutorials (60 minutes)</li>
<ul><li>In depth talks on LLVM infrastructure or other core libraries</li></ul>
<li>Student Research Competition Technical Talks & Poster (20-25 minutes including Q&A)</li>
<li>Lightning Talks (5 minutes, no questions, no discussions)</li>
<li>Birds of a Feather (30 minutes)**</li>
<li>Panels (30-60 minutes)**</li>
<li>Posters (1 hour)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
** As the LLVM Developers’ Meeting as grown in size, we are moving away from formal Birds of a Feather sessions in favor of smaller informal round table discussions. These round table topics can be proposed closer to the LLVM Developers’ Meeting and are designed for a smaller and more engaged group of developers. Therefore, we are encouraging and recommending that instead of a birds of a feather sessions, that developers consider proposing a panel discussion. This would mean that several experts on a topic (and a moderator) would get together and have an open discussion in front of an audience with prepared questions and also questions from the audience. The program committee will be looking for these proposals and giving favor to them over more traditional birds of a feather proposals that we have had in the past.
</p>

<p>Submission Requirements:<br>
The submission deadline is August 12, 2019 at 11:59PM PDT.

</p>

<p>Student Research Competition (SRC):
<br>We will again have a Student Research Competition (SRC). The SRC offers students doing LLVM related research a non-academic platform to announce and advertise their work as well as to discuss it with other researchers, developers and users of LLVM. Students are asked to submit a proposal for a 20-25 minute technical talk. There will be a prize for the best SRC talk.
