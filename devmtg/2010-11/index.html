<p>The meeting serves as a forum for <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>,
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>, <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> and 
other LLVM project developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and 
exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we
believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel 
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="registration">Registration & Logistics</div>

<p>Registration and logistical information coming soon. Please stay tuned.</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="speakers">Call for Speakers</div>

<p>We are looking for speakers for this year's developers meeting! Specifically
we'd love talks on the LLVM, Clang, LLDB, core infrastructure, new uses and 
applications of LLVM components, etc.</p>
<p>If you are interested in presenting at this year's LLVM Developers'  
Meeting, please submit your talk proposal to us by <b>September 22, 2010</b> via  
the <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/talk.php">website</a>.</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="sponsors">Sponsors Needed</div>
	
<p>We are looking for companies to fund active contributors or students to present at this years meeting. We are also looking for companies to sponsor a dinner event after the meeting. Please <a href="mailto:tonic@nondot.org">email us</a> if your company is able to help.</p> 

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="funding">Funding for Active Contributors/Students</div>

<p>At this time, we are not sure if there will be funding for active contributors or students to attend the event. However, we are hopeful that we will have company sponsorship to make this happen. Those who are funded are required to present at the meeting and may have other requirements from their sponsor (ie. writing a blog post, etc).</p>

<p>If you need funding to attend the meeting, please submit your request to us by <b>September 22, 2010</b> via  the <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/students.php">website</a>.</p>
