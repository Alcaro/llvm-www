<p>The LLVM developers' meeting is a bi-annual 2 day gathering of the entire
LLVM Project community. The conference is organized by the LLVM Foundation and
many volunteers within the LLVM community. Developers and users of LLVM, Clang,

discussions, and networking with the many members of our community. Whether you
