<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>

<p>The LLVM developers' meeting is a bi-annual 2 day gathering of the entire
LLVM Project community. The conference is organized by the LLVM Foundation and
many volunteers within the LLVM community. Developers and users of LLVM, Clang,
and related subprojects will enjoy attending interesting talks, impromptu
discussions, and networking with the many members of our community. Whether you
are a new to the LLVM project or a long time member, there is something for
each attendee.</p>

<p>What can you can expect at an LLVM developers' meeting?
<dl>
<dt><b>Technical Talks</b></dt>
<dd>These 30 minute talks cover all topics from core infrastructure talks,
to project's using LLVM's infrastructure. Attendees will take away technical
information that could be pertinent to their project or general interest.</li>
<br></dd>

<dt><b>Tutorials</b></dt>
<dd>Tutorials are 60 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical
topic. Expect in depth examples and explanations.</dd>

<dt><b>Lightning Talks</b></dt>
<dd>These are fast 5 minute talks that give you a taste of a project or topic.
Attendees will hear a wide range of topics and probably leave wanting to learn
more.</dd>

<dt><b>Birds of a Feather (BoF)</b></dt>
<dd>BoF sessions are more formal guided discussions about a specific topic. The
presenter typically has slides to guide the discussion. The audience is given
the opportunity to participate in the discussion.
</dd>

<dt><b>Student Research Competition</b> </dt>
<dd>Students present their research using LLVM or related subproject. These are
usually 25 minute technical presentations with Q&amp;A. The audience will vote
at the end for the winning presentation. Students also present their research
during the poster session.</dd>

<dt><b>Poster Session</b></dt>
<dd>An hour long poster session where selected posted are on display.</dd>

<dt><b>Round Table Discussions</b> </dt>
<dd>Informal and impromptu discussions on a specific topic. During the
conference there are set time slots where groups can organize to discuss a
problem or topic.</dd>

<dt><b>Evening Reception</b> </dt>
<dd>After a full day if technical talks and discussions, join your fellow
attendees for an evening reception to continue the conversation and meet even
more attendees.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>What types of people attend?
<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Students and Researchers</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="cfp">Call for papers</div>

<p>All developers and users of LLVM and related sub-projects are invited to
present at EuroLLVM'19.</p>

<p>We are looking for the following proposals:

    other core libraries, with in depth examples and explanations.</li>
  <li><b>Student Research Competition (25 minutes talk including Q&amp;A +

    non-academic platform to announce and advertise their work as well as to
    discuss it with other researchers, developers and users of LLVM. Students
    are strongly encouraged to present a poster as well, as this will enable
    wider discussions with the audience. There will be a prize for the best SRC
    talk.</li>
