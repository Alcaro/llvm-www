<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>

We are pleased to announce the third European LLVM conference on April 29-30 2013 in Paris, France.

This will be a two day conference which aims to present the latest developments
in the LLVM world and help strengthen the network of LLVM developers.  The
format will be similar to that of the previous meetings held in London but with
more time for presentations and networking.  The meeting is open to anyone
whether from business or academia, professional or enthusiast and is not
restricted to those from Europe - attendees from all regions are welcome.

<h2 id="callfor">Call for Speakers, Posters, Demos</h2>

We invite academic, industrial and hobbyist speakers to present their work on
developing or using LLVM, Clang, etc.  Proposals for technical presentations,
posters, workshops, demonstrations and BoFs are welcome.  Material will be
chosen to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics at various depths, some
technical deep-diving, some surface-scratching.

We are looking for:
<ol>
 <li>Keynote speakers.</li>
 <li>Technical presentations (30 minutes plus questions and discussion) related
 to development of LLVM, Clang etc.</li>
 <li>Presentations relating to academic or commercial use of LLVM, Clang
 etc.</li>
 <li>Lightning talks (5 minutes, no questions, no discussion).</li>
 <li>Workshops and in-depth tutorials (1-2 hours - please specify in your
 submission).</li>
</ol>

The deadline for receiving submissions is March 1st, 2013.  Speakers will be
notified of acceptance or rejection by the 15th of March.  Proposals that are
not sufficiently detailed (talks lacking a comprehensive abstract for example)
are likely to be rejected.  Slides and posters must be in PDF format.
Submissions should be done by email at
<a href="mailto:euro-llvm-2013-technical-committee@googlegroups.com">
euro-llvm-2013-technical-committee@googlegroups.com</a>.

Please note that presentation materials and videos for the technical sessions
will be posted on llvm.org after the conference.

<p>Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure is a university in the historic university
quarter of Paris. It is easily accessible. A direct train connection (RER-B)
from the train station ''Gare de Nord/Est'' as well as from Paris Charles de
Gaulles airport leaves you at RER station ''Luxembourg'' which is in walking
distance to Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. The metro stations "Cardinal
Lemoine", "Place Monge" and "Censier-Daubenton" are also nearby.</p>

<h2 id="hotel">Hotels</h2>

<p>As the conference is hosted in a university, there is no dedicated conference
hotel. Instead, we ask each attendee to book the hotel by himself. There
are plenty of hotels in Paris, both in walking distance as well as in close
metro distance. However, we suggest to book hotels early as spring is a pleasant
time in Paris and so the best deals may be gone soon.</p>

<h2 id="organisation">Organisation</h2>

The mailing list <b><a
href="mailto:llvm-devmeeting@cs.uiuc.edu">llvm-devmeeting@cs.uiuc.edu</a></b>
can be used to discuss issues of general interest related to the conference
organization, such as suggestions for special kinds of side-sessions.

<h2 id="support">Financial Support</h2>

There may be a possibility of limited funding to help students or contributors
who could not otherwise attend the conference.  This will depend on overall
sponsorship and companies' interest in supporting the event.

If you need funding to attend the meeting, or can help sponsor, please tell us
on the registration form.

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

The detailed schedule is not yet announced. However, we plan to have talks
between Monday noon and Tuesday noon, supplemented by more informal meetings
and workshops on Tuesday afternoon.
