<p>Dear LLVM user,</p>
<p>We are proud to announce the second European LLVM event on April 12-13 2012 in London, UK, starting at noon on April 12th .
This will be a full one-day conference with the intention and aim of exposing new developments and supporting and strengthening the network of LLVM developers around Europe. The format will resemble that of the previous meeting held in London in September 2011 but with more time for presentations and networking. The meeting is open to anyone from corporate to academia, professionals to enthusiasts, and is not in any way limited to those from Europe - people from other regions are welcome.</p>

<h4>Format</h4>

<p>We intend the conference to consist of one full day of presentations and BoFs running from noon to noon (12pm Thursday - 12pm Friday), followed by optional workshops on Friday afternoon to cover broader technical areas and help familiarise attendees with LLVM internals and use cases.</p>

<p>This format depends on receiving sufficient presentation and workshop proposals.</p>

<h4>Call for Speakers, Posters, Demos</h4>

<p>We invite academic, industrial and hobbyist speakers to present their work on developing or using LLVM and Clang. We invite abstracts for technical presentations, posters, workshops, demonstrations and BoFs relating to LLVM/Clang development and use. Material will be chosen to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics at various depths, some technical deep-diving, some surface-scratching.</p>

<p>We are looking for:
<ul>
<li>Keynote speakers.</li>
<li>Technical presentations (30 minutes plus questions and discussion) relation to LLVM and Clang.</li>
<li>Presentations relating to academic or commercial use of LLVM and Clang.</li>
<li>Workshops and in-depth tutorials (1-2 hours - please specify in your abstract).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The deadline for receiving an extended abstract is February 10th, 2012. Speakers will be notified of acceptance or rejection before February 24th. The final submission deadline is March 30th. Slides and posters must be in PDF format.</p>

<p>Please note that presentation materials and videos for the technical sessions will be posted on llvm.org after the conference.</p>

<h4>Organisation</h4>

<p>We'll be discussing the organisation of the event on the main LLVM mailing list (llvmdev at cs.uiuc.edu), and we welcome suggestions and help.</p>

<h4>Registration</h4>

<p>Registration is now open and is via email (Euro-LLVM at arm.com), on a first-come-first-served basis, free of charge.  Please send your details (name, email, company/institution) and we'll publish this on the official LLVM website (unless requested otherwise). Attendance will be limited to about 100 people.</p>

<p>A dinner will be provided on Thursday evening - this will also be free of charge. Please include whether you'll be attending the dinner in your registration email. The venue is a hotel and we will make some rooms available at a discounted price at <a href="https://hotelres.vbookings.co.uk/b/armeullvm/">https://hotelres.vbookings.co.uk/b/armeullvm/</a>.</p>

<h4>Financial Support</h4>

<p>There may be a possibility of limited funding to help students or contributors who could not otherwise attend the conference.  This will depend on overall sponsorship and companies' interest in supporting the event. Those who are funded will be required to present something at the meeting  (a poster, chair a BoF, a lightning talk, a full presentation...) and may have other obligations to the sponsor (e.g. writing a blog post or a trip report).</p>

<p>If you need funding to attend the meeting, or can help sponsor, please tell us in your registration email (to Euro-LLVM at arm.com).</p>

<h4>About LLVM</h4>

<p>The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time  code generators, and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM uses a  single, language-independent virtual instruction set both as an offline code representation (to communicate code between compiler  phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal  representation (to analyse and transform programs). This persistent  code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler  techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time, run- time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).</p>

<p>The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely simple  design (which makes it easy to understand and use), source-language  independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated compiler  debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and reliability.  LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of academic research projects and commercial projects.</p>
