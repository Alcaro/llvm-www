<h3>Latest communication</h3>

<p>Hi,</p>
 
<p>The first EU LLVM conference is tomorrow! You're receiving this email because you're registered – if you’re no longer interested in coming please reply back ASAP as we have a waiting list!</p>
 
<p>Ideally you should all know this already but the event is being held at the Hotel Russell, Russell Square, London WC1B 5BE. From the Russell Square tube station, exit the station turning left, then turn left again and the hotel is immediately on your left (turn 270 degrees counterclockwise whilst walking forwards...)</p>
 
<p>The event will be on the ground floor towards the left as you come in the main door, but there should be signage.</p>
 
<p>Please note, we have a slot available for an impromptu BoF or extra lightning talks - this will be announced at the introduction and anyone is welcome to suggest a topic. We also have plenty of available slots for lightning talks still (we only have 2 so far!) so if you have something prepared or need a soapbox for your (targetted, to-the-point) rant, please let one of the organisers know when you turn up :)</p>
 
<p>Event registration begins at 12:00 noon. There will be a buffet lunch served from 12:30, followed by the conference opening at 13:30. The schedule is attached.</p>
 
<p>The main presentations end at 12:45 on Friday, after which (and after lunch) there will be optional workshops. We’ll be asking you when you sign up to register for these, in order to give their organisers some sort of heads-up as to expected numbers. You are by no means pinned down to either attending or not attending based on this! :) David Chisnall's workshop is expected to be longer than Anton's, so if you wish to attend that the expected finishing time is 15:30 ± <i>delta-t</i></p>
 
<p>We'll be handing out feedback forms at opportune moments throughout the conference - these contain ratings for each individual presentation as well as aspects of the event itself - please fill these in, they are invaluable for producing a quality event next year. Please also don't pull any punches - This is the first event on this scale we have put on, so for sure there will be areas where we will be lacking.</p>
 
<p>There will be complementary wireless available for the 24h period from 12:00 noon Thursday to 12:00 noon Friday. More information about this will be provided on registration. Note that if you are staying at the hotel overnight, the wireless coverage does not extend upstairs - you will have wired Ethernet access in your room. Plenty of power sockets should be supplied throughout the main meeting room.</p>
 
<p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'll also be the slightly flustered looking bloke in the ARM t-shirt tomorrow.</p>
 
<p>See you all tomorrow!</p>
 
<p>Cheers,</p>
 
<p>James</p>
