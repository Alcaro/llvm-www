<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the first LLVM Cauldron, to be held on Thursday
September 8th 2016 in Hebden Bridge, UK. This is the day before the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2016">GNU Tools
Cauldron</a> being held at the same venue, so we hope to take advantage of the
high concentration of compiler enthusiasts and to encourage lots of
cross-pollination between communities.
</p>

<p>
This will be a one-day conference with a single talks track and a space for
breakout sessions, birds of a feather, and potentially tutorials. The meeting
is free to attend and open to anyone whether a hobbyist, from academia, or from
industry, and regardless of previous experience with LLVM.
</p>

<p>
The conference keynote will be delivered by <a 
  href="http://wingolog.org/about/">Andy Wingo</a>, maintainer of the <a 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a> Scheme implementation 
and committer to V8 and SpiderMonkey. His talk will focus on compilation using 
persistent data structures, a technique used in Guile's <a 
  href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2015/07/27/cps-soup">intermediate 
language</a>.
</p>

<p>
Much like the LLVM Developers' meetings, we
believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel 
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This inaugural LLVM Cauldron will form part of the <a
href="http://wutheringbytes.com/">Wuthering Bytes</a> technology festival in
Hebden Bridge in the UK. Situated at the heart of the UK's
"Northern Powerhouse", Hebden Bridge is roughly equidistant from Liverpool,
Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford. The Wuthering Bytes festival is a 10
day celebration of all things technological that are free and open source.
</p>

<p>
The LLVM Cauldron is organised by:
<ul>
  <li>Alex Bradbury</li>
  <li>Ed Jones</li>
  <li>Judith Jones</li>
  <li>Diana Picus</li>
  <li>Konstantina Mitropoulou</li>
</ul>


<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="dates">Important Dates</div>
<p>

<li>July 4: Call for Papers</li>
<li>August 8: Paper Submission Deadline</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="register">Registration</div>

<p>
Registration is free, and is now open. Please fill out the <a 
href="http://goo.gl/forms/IqKzBtIYJIgEZf3G2">registration form</a>.


<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="cfp">Call for Papers</div>
<p>
We welcome proposals for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>technical presentations (25 minutes)</li>
  <li>lightning talks (5 minutes)</li>
  <li>birds of a feather sessions (~30 minutes)</li>
  <li>tutorials (60 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Material will be chosen to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics from 
across the LLVM/Clang projects at various depths, some technical deep-diving, 
some surface-scratching. We particularly welcome novel downstream 
modifications or uses. Presentations on work-in-progress are encouraged, and 
there is no requirement that the work hasn't been published elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Please submit your proposals <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/iFEPwjjLhNHeFeru2">here</a>.
The submissions deadline is the 8th August 2016, though we encourage early submission and expect to 
confirm a number of proposals prior to that date.
