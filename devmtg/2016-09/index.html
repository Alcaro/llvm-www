<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the first LLVM Cauldron, to be held on Thursday
September 8th 2016 in Hebden Bridge, UK. This is the day before the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2016">GNU Tools
Cauldron</a> being held at the same venue, so we hope to take advantage of the
high concentration of compiler enthusiasts and to encourage lots of
cross-pollination between communities.
</p>

<p>
This will be a one-day conference with a single talks track and a space for
breakout sessions, birds of a feather, and potentially tutorials. The meeting
is free to attend and open to anyone whether a hobbyist, from academia, or from
industry, and regardless of previous experience with LLVM.
</p>

<p>
The conference keynote will be delivered by <a 
  href="http://wingolog.org/about/">Andy Wingo</a>, maintainer of the <a 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile</a> Scheme implementation 
and committer to V8 and SpiderMonkey. His talk will focus on compilation using 
persistent data structures, a technique used in Guile's <a 
  href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2015/07/27/cps-soup">intermediate 
language</a>.
</p>

<p>
Much like the LLVM Developers' meetings, we
believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, dragonegg, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel 
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This inaugural LLVM Cauldron will form part of the <a
href="http://wutheringbytes.com/">Wuthering Bytes</a> technology festival in
Hebden Bridge in the UK. Situated at the heart of the UK's
"Northern Powerhouse", Hebden Bridge is roughly equidistant from Liverpool,
Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Bradford. The Wuthering Bytes festival is a 10
day celebration of all things technological that are free and open source.

<p>
Stay tuned for more talks to be announced. We're thrilled that <a 
href="http://wingolog.org/about/">Andy Wingo</a> will be presenting the 
keynote on compilation with persistent data structures.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Title</b>: Optimizing with persistent data structures</li>
  <li><b>Abstract</b>: Is there life beyond phi variables and basic blocks? 
  Andy will report on his experience using a new intermediate representation 
  for compiler middle-ends, "CPS soup". The CPS soup language represents 
  programs using Clojure-inspired maps, allowing optimizations to be neatly 
  expressed as functions from one graph to another. Using these persistent 
  data structures also means that the source program doesn't change while the 
  residual program is being created, eliminating one class of problems that 
  the optimizer writer has to keep in mind. Together we will look at some 
  example transformations from an expressiveness as well as a performance 
  point of view, and we will also cover some advantages which a traditional 
  SSA graph maintains over CPS soup.</li>
  <li><b>Bio</b>: Andy loves compilers. He has co-maintained the Guile
  implementation of Scheme since 2009, and has also worked on the V8 and
  SpiderMonkey JavaScript engines. He just passed his five-year
  anniversary at <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a>, a consultancy 
  out of Spain that is organized as a
  worker-owned cooperative. After all these years, Andy's favorite
  compilers paper is still "Lambda, the ultimate GOTO".</li>
</ul>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="register">Registration</div>

<p>
Registration is free, and is now open. Please fill out the <a 
href="http://goo.gl/forms/IqKzBtIYJIgEZf3G2">registration form</a>.
</p>


<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="cfp">Call for Papers</div>
<p>
We welcome proposals for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>technical presentations (25 minutes)</li>
  <li>lightning talks (5 minutes)</li>
  <li>birds of a feather sessions (~30 minutes)</li>
  <li>tutorials (60 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Material will be chosen to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics from 
across the LLVM/Clang projects at various depths, some technical deep-diving, 
some surface-scratching. We particularly welcome novel downstream 
modifications or uses. Presentations on work-in-progress are encouraged, and 
there is no requirement that the work hasn't been published elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Please submit your proposals <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/iFEPwjjLhNHeFeru2">here</a>.
The submissions deadline is the 8th August 2016, though we encourage early submission and expect to 
confirm a number of proposals prior to that date.
