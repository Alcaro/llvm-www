<div class="www_sectiontitle">The First Workshop on LLVM in Parallel Processing (LLPP) will be held at ICPP 2021</div>

<p>
  The LLVM framework is a vast ecosystem that stretches far beyond a "simple"
  C/C++ compiler. The variety of programming-language and toolchain-related
  parts includes the components to support a host of parallel programming
  models and libraries, including CUDA, HIP, OpenMP, SYCL, and the C++ parallel
  algorithms. In addition, LLVM serves as a vehicle for various languages in
  which parallelism is a first class citizen, such as Julia or Chapel.

  The workshop is held in conjunction with the ICPP during the workshop day.

  If you are interested in attending the workshop, please register at the
  <a href="https://oaciss.uoregon.edu/icpp21/index.php">ICPP website.</a>

  Note: It has not yet been decided if the workshop will be held in person or
  virtual, please see the ICPP website for more information. Depending on the
  decision for the conference we will try to accomodate all interested parties.
