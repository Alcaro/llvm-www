LLVM Project community. The conference is organized by the LLVM Foundation and
many volunteers within the LLVM community. Developers and users of LLVM, Clang,

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="cfp">Call for Presentations</div>

<p>All developers and users of LLVM and related sub-projects are invited to
present and discuss at the EuroLLVM'20 developersâ€™ meeting.</p>

<p>We are looking for the following proposals:
<ul>
  <li><b>Technical Talks (25 minutes + 5 minutes Q&amp;A):</b>
   <ul>
     <li>On any llvm project such as the core libraries, clang, mlir, flang, etc.</li>
     <li>On uses of LLVM in academia or industry</li>
     <li>On new projects using Clang or LLVM</li>
     <li>On any other LLVM-related topic of interest to participants.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Tutorials (60 minutes):</b> in depth talks focussed on helping less
    experienced people get up to speed on an aspect of the LLVM project, with
    in depth examples and explanations.</li>
  <li><b>Student Research Competition Technical Talks & Poster (25 minutes + 5
     minutes Q&amp;A):</b> The SRC offers students doing LLVM related research a
     non-academic platform to announce and advertise their work as well as to
     discuss it with other researchers, developers and users of LLVM. Students
     are strongly encouraged to present a poster as well, as this will enable
     wider discussions with the audience. An embargo period to delay the
     publication of the abstract/talk/poster is possible. There will be a prize for
     the best SRC entry.</li>
  <li><b>Lightning Talks (5 minutes, no questions, no discussions)</b></li>
  <li><b>Panels / round tables (30-60 minutes) / Birds of a Feather (BoF) (30 minutes):</b>
     <p>These are all discussion formats. The best format is probably mostly
     dependent on the number of expected participants. For small group
     highly-engaged discussion, round tables are expected to work best. Round
     table topics can be proposed closer to the EuroLLVM meeting.</p>
     <p>For discussions that are expected to attract larger groups, either a BoF
     or Panel format is expected to work better. A BoF session is run in a
     presentation-like setup, and therefore is expected to have somewhat less
     free-flowing discussion than a round table.</p>
     <p>We encourage proposals for a panel format where several experts (and a
     moderator) on a topic get together and have an open discussion in front of
     an audience with prepared questions and also questions from the audience. The
     program committee will be looking for panel proposals and giving favor to
     them over more traditional BoF proposals.</p></li>
  <li><b>Posters (1 hour)</b></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Submission Requirements:</b></p>

<p>The submission deadline is January 11, 2020 at 11:59PM AoE (Anywhere on Earth).</p>

<p>Please submit your proposal to the
<a href="https://hotcrp.llvm.org/eurollvm2020/">EuroLLVM'20 submission site</a>.</p>

<p>For each proposal, please submit a title, short abstract, submission type,
abstract for the website, and include who the speakers or panel
member/moderators are. If you wish, you can provide a more detailed description
of the talk through an extended PDF abstract. We highly recommend you consult
and follow the <a href="cfp-faq.html">FAQ</a> and the <a href="cfp-guide.html">guide</a> when
submitting your proposal.</p>
