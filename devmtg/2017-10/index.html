<p>
The LLVM Foundation announces the 11th annual US LLVM Developers' Meeting
will be held October 18th and 19th in San Jose, California. <b>New this year will be a Women in Compilers & Tools Event on October 17th (details coming soon).</b>
</p>

<p>
The conference will include technical talks, BoFs, hacker's lab, tutorials, and
posters.
</p>

<p>
The meeting serves as a forum for <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>,
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>,
<a href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> and other LLVM project developers and
users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM
and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we believe the event will be of
particular interest to the following people:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<b>FAQ</b>

<b>When will I be notified of acceptance?</b>
<br>
Our goal is to notify all proposal submitters by September 1, 2017. 
<br>
<b>What are panels?</b>
<br>
Panels may discuss any topic as long as it’s relevant to LLVM or related sub-projects. Panels can take many forms, but a common format is to begin with an introduction of the panel members, have short presentations from each panel member, and follow with an interactive dialogue among the panelists and audience members. Panels should consist of 3-5 people including a moderator. 
<br>
<b>Should I register if I have submitted a proposal?</b>
<br>
We have 1 complimentary reserved  registration for each accepted technical talk, BoF, or student research competition talk. Accepted tutorials have been reserved 2 complimentary registrations. Panels have up to 3 reserved registrations. There are no reserved registration spots for posters or lightning talks. So please register any additional speakers or if you do not have a reserved registration slot.
<br>
<b>What if I registered and my talk got accepted?</b>
<br>
We can refund your registration fee and instructions will be sent following notification.  If you plan to attend even if your proposal is not accepted and are worried about the event selling out, we suggest registering before notification of acceptance.
<br>
<b>What if I registered and my talk DID NOT get accepted?</b>
<br>
We can refund your registration fee if you no longer wish to attend if you contact the organizer by September 15, 2017.
<br>
<b>What will be recorded?</b>
<br>
All technical talks, tutorials, SRC talks, panels, and lightning talks will be recorded. By submitting your proposal, you are giving us permission to record if you present at the meeting. For SRC talks, you have the option to delay publication of the slides and video for you talk for up to 12 months.
<br>
