We are pleased to announce the 5th European LLVM conference on April 13-14, 2015 in London, England. <br/><br/>

This will be a full two-day conference which aims to present the latest developments in the LLVM world
and help strengthen the network of LLVM developers and users. The format will be similar to that of the
previous meetings, with ample time for presentations, discussion, and networking between participants.
The meeting is open to anyone whether from industry or academia, professional or enthusiast and is not
restricted to those from Europe - attendees from all regions are welcome.<br/>

We invite academic, industrial and hobbyist speakers to present their work on developing or using LLVM,
Clang, etc. Proposals for technical presentations, posters, workshops, demonstrations and BoFs are welcome.
Material will be chosen to cover a broad spectrum of themes and topics at various depths, some technical
deep-diving, some surface-scratching.<br/>

We are looking for:<br/>

<ul>
  <li>Keynote speakers.</li>
  <li>Technical presentations (30 minutes plus questions and discussion) related to development of LLVM, Clang etc.</li>
  <li>Presentations relating to academic or commercial use of LLVM, Clang etc.</li>
  <li>Lightning talks (5 minutes, no questions, no discussion).</li>
  <li>Workshops and in-depth tutorials (1-2 hours please specify in your submission).</li>
  <li>Poster presentations.</li>
</ul>

The deadline for receiving submissions is February 16th 2015.  Speakers will be notified of acceptance or rejection by March 5th 2015.
Proposals that are not sufficiently detailed (talks lacking a comprehensive abstract for example) are likely to be rejected.
Slides and posters must be in PDF format.<br/><br/>

Submissions should be done using the Easychair platform:<br/><br/>

<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eurollvm2015">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eurollvm2015</a><br/><br/>

Please note that presentation materials and videos for the technical sessions will be posted on llvm.org after the conference.
We have reserved additional spots for speakers, such that they can attend the conference even though
we have reached our registration limit.<br/><br/>

<b>Submission Style:</b><br/><br/>

We are looking for:<br/>

<ul>
  <li>A title and an extended abstract, OR</li>
  <li>A title, abstract and some slides.</li>
</ul>

Please make clear the status of the slides: Are they a skeleton of your presentation with the detail missing?
Or, perhaps a section of detail that lacks introduction and conclusions?  The more you can give us and tell us
the easier it will be for us to be positive about your submission.<br/><br/>
