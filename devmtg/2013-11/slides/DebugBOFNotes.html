<h1>Debug Info BOF</h1>
<h3><i>Eric Christopher</i></h3>

<p>Optimized debugging is still a big miss with a lof of metadata being lost at
   various stages, mostly affecting variable tracking, leastly affecting line
   information.</p>

<p>Dwarf 4 seems to be the standard that LLVM is being coded to, Dwarf 3 in
   maintenance mode, Dwarf 2 is dead. Still, would be good to have some mechanism
   to limit the version of Dwarf symbols, to avoid breaking compatibility with
   older toolchains for a small feature.</p>

<p>In time, Dwarf 3 will be deprecated, and the story will repeat, and itâ€™s clear
   and accepted by all that this is the natural course of thing.</p>

<p>Verifier will check debug info, so metadata is supposed to be consistent
   after validation.</p>

<p>Metadata may lose type information and be left with line, function and scope
   info. The rest can be inferred from IR.</p>

<p>Debug metadata is widely known to be huge and methods to reduce the size in
   IR are being considered, including emitting Dwarf directly in IR, converting
   the most common constructs to text literals (including small numbers, < 4-8
   digits), packing (zip) the contents, etc.</p>
