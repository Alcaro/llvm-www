<p>This will be a half-day meeting for LLVM users to exchange ideas, expose new
developments and generally strengthen the network of LLVM developers in and
around Europe. The meeting is open to anyone, from corporate to academia,
professionals to enthusiasts.</p>

<p>While this is not a full conference like the US LLVM Developers' Meeting, we
plan to have talks, posters, demonstrations and a lot of discussion. We hope
that those most active in LLVM development will consider attending both
meetings.</p>

<p>The topic themes for the September 2011 meeting include:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>CPU architecture support, code generation, generic optimizations</li>
<li>OpenCL and graphics processing</li>
<li>Interesting research and projects using the LLVM infrastructure</li>
<li>Current developments and the future of LLVM (MC, JIT, vectorisation, &amp;c.)</li>
</ul></p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="organisation">Organisation</div>

<p>We'll be discussing the organisation of the event on the 
<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">main LLVM mailing list</a>,
and we welcome suggestions and help. The event
will take place during the afternoon and we'll provide dinner and some beer
at the end to complement the networking.</p>


<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="registration">Registration:</div>

<p>Registration is via email (Euro-LLVM@arm.com), on a first-come-first-serve
basis, free of charge. Please, send your details (name, email,
company/institution) and we'll publish this in the official LLVM website
(unless requested otherwise). Attendance will be limited to about 60 people,
depending on the venue.</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="support">Financial Support:</div>

<p>At this time, we cannot be sure if there will be funding for active
contributors and students to attend the event. However, we are hopeful that
we will have company sponsorship to make this happen. Those who are funded
are required to present at the meeting and may have other requirements from
their sponsor (i.e. writing a blog post, etc).</p>

<p>If you need funding to attend the meeting, please tell us in your
registration email (to Euro-LLVM@arm.com).</p>
