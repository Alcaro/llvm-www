<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>
<p>The meeting serves as a forum for LLVM, Clang, LLDB and other LLVM project 
developers and users to get acquainted, learn how LLVM is used, and exchange 
ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. The conference will be 
two full days that include technical talks, BoFs, hackerâ€™s lab, tutorials, 
a poster session and a reception. </p>

<p>We believe the event will be of particular interest to the following 
 people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella
(LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, lld, etc).</li>
<li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
<li>Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel
and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please sign up for the
<a href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-devmeeting">
LLVM Developers' Meeting list</a> for future announcements and to ask questions.
