<div class="www_sectiontitle">The Second Workshop on LLVM Compiler and Tools for HPC will be held at ISC-HPC 2021</div>

<p>
  The LLVM framework is a vast ecosystem surrounding a compiler core which
  enabled various advances in source-code tools, debuggers, linkers, and a
  whole host of programming-language and toolchain-related components. Similar
  to the very successful LLVM-HPC workshop at SuperComputing (SC), we want to
  provide a forum for LLVM-related discussions and talks from academia and
  industry at ISC.

  The workshop is held in conjunction with the ISC-HPC during the ISC workshop
  day.

  If you are interested in attending the workshop, please register at the
  <a href="https://www.isc-hpc.com">ISC-HPC website.</a>

  Note: The workshop will be virtual, we expect to record the talks and make
  them available afterwards.

<div class="www_sectiontitle" id="about">About</div>

We will have invited talks but are looking for contributions at the same time.
We do not expect to have proceedings and submissions can be in the form of a
(extended) abstract or preliminary slide-deck. More information is to follow.

<h4>Past Attendees</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, klee, lld,
    OpenMP, etc).</li>
  <li>Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.</li>
  <li>Students and Researchers.</li>
  <li>Compiler, programming language, HPC, runtime and tooling enthusiasts.</li>
  <li>Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Panels</h4>
Panel sessions are guided discussions about a specific topic. The panel consists of ~3 developers who discuss a topic
through prepared questions from a moderator. The audience is also given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.

<h4>Birds of a Feather (BoF)</h4>
A BoF session, an informal meeting at conferences, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and
carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda.

<h4>Technical Talks</h4>
These 20-30 minute talks cover all topics from core infrastructure talks, to project's using LLVM's infrastructure.
Attendees will take away technical information that could be pertinent to their project or general interest.

<h4>Tutorials</h4>
Tutorials are 50-60 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and
explanations.
