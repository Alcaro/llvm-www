<p>Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is:</p>

<ol>

<li><p><a href="pubs/2004-01-30-CGO-LLVM.html"> A compilation strategy</a>
designed to enable effective program optimization across the entire lifetime of
a program.  LLVM supports effective optimization at compile time, link-time
(particularly interprocedural), run-time and offline (i.e., after software is
installed), while remaining transparent to developers and maintaining
compatibility with existing build scripts.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="docs/LangRef.html">A virtual instruction set</a> - LLVM
is a low-level object code representation that uses simple RISC-like
instructions, but provides rich, language-independent, type information and
dataflow (SSA) information about operands. This combination enables
sophisticated transformations on object code, while remaining light-weight
enough to be attached to the executable. This combination is key to allowing
link-time, run-time, and offline transformations.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="pubs/2002-12-LattnerMSThesis.html">A compiler infrastructure</a>
- LLVM is also a collection of source code that implements the language and
compilation strategy. The primary components of the LLVM infrastructure are a
GCC-based <a href="docs/CommandGuide/html/llvmgcc.html">C &amp; C++
front-end</a>, a link-time optimization framework with a growing set of global
and interprocedural analyses and transformations, static back-ends for 
<a href="Features.html">many popular (and some obscure)</a> architectures,
a back-end which emits portable C code, and a Just-In-Time compilers for
several architectures.</p></li>

<li><p>LLVM does <i>not</i> imply things that you would expect from a 
high-level virtual machine.  It does not require garbage collection or 
run-time code generation (In fact, LLVM makes a great static compiler!).
Note that optional LLVM components can be used to <i>build</i> high-level 
virtual machines and other systems that need these services.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>LLVM is a robust system, particularly well suited for developing new
mid-level <a href="pubs/2005-05-04-LattnerPHDThesis.html">
language-independent analyses and optimizations</a> of all sorts,
including those that require <a href="pubs/2003-05-05-LCTES03-CodeSafety.html">
extensive interprocedural analysis</a>.  LLVM is also a great target for <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/">front-end development</a> for conventional or research
programming languages, including those which require <a
href="pubs/2004-01-30-CGO-LLVM.html">compile-time, link-time, or run-time
optimization</a> for effective implementation, proper tail calls or garbage
collection.  We have an incomplete <a
href="ProjectsWithLLVM/">list of projects</a> which have used LLVM for various
purposes, showing that you can get up-and-running quickly with LLVM, giving time
to do interesting things, even if you only have a semester in a University
course.  We also have a list of <a href="OpenProjects.html">ideas for 
projects</a> in LLVM.</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle">Want to learn more?</div>

<p>If you'd like to learn more about LLVM, take a look at the <a 
href="docs/tutorial/">LLVM Tutorials</a> and the extensive
<a href="docs/">documentation</a> for LLVM.  In particular, all of
the tools distributed with LLVM are described in the <a
href="docs/CommandGuide/">LLVM Command Guide</a>.  If you're interested in what
source-language features and optimizations we support, please check out the <a
href="demo/">LLVM demo page</a>.  If you'd like to browse through the source
code, either check out <a href="/doxygen/">doxygen</a> or <a
href="releases/">download the most recent release</a>.  Finally, if you're
interested in LLVM, have questions, and can't find any answers, please ask on
the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">LLVM
Developer</a> mailing list.</p>

<div class="www_text">
  <p><b>April 27, 2010</b>: LLVM 2.7 is now <a href="releases/"><b>available
  for download</b></a>!  LLVM is publicly available under an open source <a
  href="releases/2.7/LICENSE.TXT">License</a>.  Also, you might want to
  check out <a href="docs/ReleaseNotes.html#whatsnew"><b>the new

<div class="www_text">
   <p>If you'd like to experiment with LLVM, but don't want to download it and
   compile it, we've got just the thing for you.  You can now compile C and C++
   <a href="/demo/">in your browser</a>, to see what the LLVM representation
   looks like, to see what various C/C++ constructs map to in LLVM, and try out
   some of the optimizers.</p>

<div class="www_sectiontitle">LLVM Reaches 100,000 Revisions!</div>

<div class="www_text">
    <p>The 100,000th revision was committed to the
    <a href="/docs/GettingStarted.html#checkoutLLVM">repository</a> on March
    30, 2010. There was much rejoicing.</p>
