<div class="www_sectiontitle">LLVM Overview</div>

<div class="www_text">

<p>The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
   toolchain technologies.  Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with
   traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that 
   can be <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org">used to build them</a>.  The name
   "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.</p>

<p>LLVM began as a <a href="pubs/2004-01-30-CGO-LLVM.html">research
   project</a> at
   the <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a>, with
   the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable
   of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary
   programming languages.  Since then, LLVM has
   grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of
   subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of
   <a href="Users.html">commercial and open source</a> projects
   as well as being widely used in <a href="pubs/">academic research</a>.  Code
   in the LLVM project is licensed under the <a
   href="docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#license">"UIUC" BSD-Style license</a>.</p>
   
<p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>
   
<ol>
<li><p>The <b>LLVM Core</b> libraries provide a modern source- and
    target-independent <a href="docs/Passes.html">optimizer</a>, along with
    <a href="docs/CodeGenerator.html">code generation support</a> for many
    popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built
    around a <a href="docs/LangRef.html">well specified</a> code representation
    known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").  The LLVM Core
    libraries are <a href="docs/">well documented</a>, and it is particularly
    easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use
    <a href="docs/tutorial/">LLVM as an optimizer and code generator</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b><a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a></b> is an "LLVM native"
    C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles
    (e.g. about <a
    href="http://clang.llvm.org/features.html#performance">3x faster than GCC</a> when
    compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful <a
    href="http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">error and warning messages</a>
    and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.  The
    <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a> is a
    tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the
    sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to
    parse C/C++ code.</p></li>

<li><p><b><a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org">dragonegg</a></b> 
    integrates the LLVM optimizers and code generator with the GCC parsers.
    This allows LLVM to compile Ada, Fortran, and other languages supported by
    the GCC compiler frontends, and access to C features not supported by Clang.
    </p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a></b> project builds on
    libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger.
    It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler,
    etc so that it provides an experience that "just works".  It is also 
    blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols.
    </p></li>
    
<li><p>The <b><a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org">libc++</a></b> and
    <b><a href="http://libcxxabi.llvm.org">libc++ ABI</a></b> projects provide
    a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++
    Standard Library, including full support for C++11.</p></li>
    
<li><p>The <b><a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org">compiler-rt</a></b> project
    provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator
    support routines like "<tt>__fixunsdfdi</tt>" and other calls generated when
    a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement
    a core IR operation. It also provides implementations of run-time libraries
    for dynamic testing tools such as
    <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">AddressSanitizer</a>,
    <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html">ThreadSanitizer</a>,
    <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html">MemorySanitizer</a>,
    and
    <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/DataFlowSanitizer.html">DataFlowSanitizer</a>.
    </p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://openmp.llvm.org">OpenMP</a></b> subproject
    provides an <a href="http://openmp.org">OpenMP</a> runtime for use with the
    OpenMP implementation in Clang.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org">vmkit</a></b> project is an
    implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM
    technologies.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://polly.llvm.org/">polly</a></b> project implements
    a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and
    vectorization using a polyhedral model.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://libclc.llvm.org/">libclc</a></b> project aims to
    implement the OpenCL standard library.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://klee.llvm.org">klee</a></b> project implements a 
    "symbolic virtual machine" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate
    all dynamic paths through a program in an effort to find bugs and to prove
    properties of functions.  A major feature of klee is that it can produce a
    testcase in the event that it detects a bug.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://safecode.cs.illinois.edu">SAFECode</a></b>
    project is a memory safety compiler for C/C++ programs.  It instruments
    code with run-time checks to detect memory safety errors (e.g., buffer
    overflows) at run-time.  It can be used to protect software from
    security attacks and can also be used as a memory safety error debugging
    tool like Valgrind.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://lld.llvm.org/">lld</a></b> project aims
    to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm.  Currently, clang must invoke
    the system linker to produce executables. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of
other projects that <a href="/ProjectsWithLLVM/">use components
of LLVM for various tasks</a>.  Through these external projects you can use
LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of
other languages.  A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and
reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different
tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages
like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.</p>

<p>As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people
who are interested in building great low-level tools.  If you are interested in
getting involved, a good first place is to skim the <a
href="http://blog.llvm.org">LLVM Blog</a> and to sign up for the <a
href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev">LLVM Developer mailing
list</a>.  For information on how to send in a patch, get commit access, and
copyright and license topics, please see <a href="docs/DeveloperPolicy.html">the
LLVM Developer Policy</a>.
