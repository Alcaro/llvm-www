<div class="www_sectiontitle">LLVM Overview</div>

<div class="www_text">

<p>The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
   toolchain technologies.  From its humble beginnings as a research project at
   the <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a>, LLVM has
   grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different
   subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of
   <a href="Users.html">commercial and open source</a> projects
   as well as being widely used in <a href="pubs/">academic research</a>.  Code
   in the LLVM project is licensed under the <a
   href="docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#license">"UIUC" BSD-Style license</a>.</p>
   
<p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>
   
<ol>
<li><p>The <b>LLVM Core</b> libraries provide a modern source- and
    target-independent <a href="docs/Passes.html">optimizer</a>, along with
    <a href="docs/CodeGenerator.html">code generation support</a> for many
    popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built
    around a <a href="docs/LangRef.html">well specified</a> code representation
    known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").  The LLVM Core
    libraries are <a href="docs/">well documented</a>, and it is particularly
    easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use
    <a href="docs/tutorial/">LLVM as a optimizer and code generator</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b><a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a></b> is an "LLVM native"
    C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to  deliver amazingly fast compiles
    (e.g. about <a
    href="http://clang.llvm.org/performance.html">3x faster than GCC</a> when
    compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful <a
    href="http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">error and warning messages</a>
    and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.  The
    <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a> is a
    tool built on Clang that automatically finds bugs in your code, and it is a
    great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang
    frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code.</p></li>
    
<li><p><b><a href="docs/CommandGuide/html/llvmgcc.html">llvm-gcc 4.2</a></b> and
    <b><a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org">dragonegg</a></b> integrate the LLVM
    optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.2 (which is GPL2) and GCC 4.5
    (which is GPL3) parsers, respectively.  This allows LLVM to compile Ada,
    Fortran, and other languages supported by the GCC compiler frontends, and
    provides high-fidelity drop-in compatibility with their
    respective versions of GCC.</p></li>
    
<li><p>The <b><a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org">libc++</a></b> project provides
    a standards conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++
    Standard Library, with an aim to supporting C++'0x when the standard is
    ratified.</p></li>
    
<li><p>The <b><a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org">compiler-rt</a></b> project
    provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator
    support routines like "<tt>__fixunsdfdi</tt>" and other calls generated when
    a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement
    a core IR operation.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org">vmkit</a></b> project is an
    implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM
    technologies.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://klee.llvm.org">klee</a></b> project implements a 
    "symbolic virtual machine" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate
    all dynamic paths through a program, in an effort to find bugs and to prove
    properties of functions.  A major feature of klee is that it can produce a
    testcase in the event that it detects a bug.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of
other projects that <a href="http://llvm.org/ProjectsWithLLVM/">use components
of LLVM for various tasks</a>.  Through these external projects you can use
LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Java, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, and a number of
other languages.  A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and
reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different
tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages
like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.</p>

<p>As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people
who are interested in building great low-level tools.  If you are interested in
getting involved, a good first place is to skim the <a
href="http://blog.llvm.org">LLVM Blog</a> and to sign up for the <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">LLVM Developer mailing
list</a>.

<div class="www_text">
  <p><b>April 27, 2010</b>: LLVM 2.7 is now <a href="releases/"><b>available
  for download</b></a>!  LLVM is publicly available under an open source <a
  href="releases/2.7/LICENSE.TXT">License</a>.  Also, you might want to
  check out <a href="docs/ReleaseNotes.html#whatsnew"><b>the new

<div class="www_text">
   <p>If you'd like to experiment with LLVM, but don't want to download it and
   compile it, we've got just the thing for you.  You can now compile C and C++
   <a href="/demo/">in your browser</a>, to see what the LLVM representation
   looks like, to see what various C/C++ constructs map to in LLVM, and try out
   some of the optimizers.</p>
