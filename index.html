<div class="www_sectiontitle">LLVM Overview</div>

<div class="www_text">

<p>The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
   toolchain technologies.  From its humble beginnings as a research project at
   the <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a>, LLVM has
   grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different
   subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of
   <a href="Users.html">commercial and open source</a> projects
   as well as being widely used in <a href="pubs/">academic research</a>.  Code
   in the LLVM project is licensed under the <a
   href="docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#license">"UIUC" BSD-Style license</a>.</p>
   
<p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>
   
<ol>
<li><p>The <b>LLVM Core</b> libraries provide a modern source language and
    target-independent <a href="docs/Passes.html">optimizer</a>, along with
    <a href="docs/CodeGenerator.html">code generation support</a> for many
    popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built
    around a <a href="docs/LangRef.html">well specified</a> code representation
    known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").  The LLVM Core
    libraries are <a href="docs/">well documented</a>, and it is particularly
    easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use
    <a href="docs/tutorial/">LLVM as a optimizer and code generator</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b><a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a></b> is an "LLVM native"
    C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to  deliver amazingly fast compiles
    (e.g. about <a
    href="http://clang.llvm.org/performance.html">3x faster than GCC</a> when
    compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful <a
    href="http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">error and warning messages</a>
    and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.  The
    <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a> is a
    tool built on Clang that automatically finds bugs in your code, it is a
    great example of the sort of tool that can be built with the Clang
    frontend.</p></li>
    
<li><p><b><a href="docs/CommandGuide/html/llvmgcc.html">llvm-gcc 4.2</a></b> and
    <b><a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org">dragonegg</a></b> integrate the LLVM
    optimizers and code generator with the GCC 4.2 (which is GPL2) and GCC 4.5
    (which is GPL3) parsers, respectively.  This allows LLVM to compile Ada,
    Fortran, and a number of other languages supported by the GCC compiler
    frontends, and provides high-fidelity drop-in compatibility with their
    respective versions of GCC.</p></li>
    
<li><p>The <b><a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org">libc++</a></b> project provides
    a standards conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++
    Standard Library, with an aim to supporting C++'0x when the standard is
    ratified.</p></li>
    
<li><p>The <b><a href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org">compiler-rt</a></b> project
    provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator
    support routines like "<tt>__fixunsdfdi</tt>" and other calls generated when
    a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement
    a core IR operation.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org">vmkit</a></b> project is an
    implementation of the Java and .NET Virtual Machines that is built on LLVM
    technologies.</p></li>

<li><p>The <b><a href="http://klee.llvm.org">klee</a></b> project implements a 
    "symbolic virtual machine" which uses a theorem prover to try to evaluate
    all dynamic paths through a program, in an effort to find bugs and to prove
    properties of functions.  A major feature of klee is that it can produce a
    testcase in the event that it detects a bug.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>As much as everything else, LLVM has a broad and friendly community of people
who are interested in building great low-level tools.  If you are interested in
getting involved, a good first place is to skim the <a
href="http://blog.llvm.org">LLVM Blog</a> and to sign up for the <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">LLVM Developer mailing
list</a>.

<li><p><a href="pubs/2004-01-30-CGO-LLVM.html"> A compilation strategy</a>
designed to enable effective program optimization across the entire lifetime of
a program.  LLVM supports effective optimization at compile time, link-time
(particularly interprocedural), run-time and offline (i.e., after software is
installed), while remaining transparent to developers and maintaining
compatibility with existing build scripts.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="docs/LangRef.html">A virtual instruction set</a> - LLVM
is a low-level object code representation that uses simple RISC-like
instructions, but provides rich, language-independent, type information and
dataflow (SSA) information about operands. This combination enables
sophisticated transformations on object code, while remaining light-weight
enough to be attached to the executable. This combination is key to allowing
link-time, run-time, and offline transformations.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="pubs/2002-12-LattnerMSThesis.html">A compiler infrastructure</a>
- LLVM is also a collection of source code that implements the language and
compilation strategy. The primary components of the LLVM infrastructure are a
GCC-based <a href="docs/CommandGuide/html/llvmgcc.html">C &amp; C++
front-end</a>, a link-time optimization framework with a growing set of global
and interprocedural analyses and transformations, static back-ends for 
<a href="Features.html">many popular (and some obscure)</a> architectures,
a back-end which emits portable C code, and a Just-In-Time compilers for
several architectures.</p></li>

<li><p>LLVM does <i>not</i> imply things that you would expect from a 
high-level virtual machine.  It does not require garbage collection or 
run-time code generation (In fact, LLVM makes a great static compiler!).
Note that optional LLVM components can be used to <i>build</i> high-level 
virtual machines and other systems that need these services.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>LLVM is a robust system, particularly well suited for developing new
mid-level <a href="pubs/2005-05-04-LattnerPHDThesis.html">
language-independent analyses and optimizations</a> of all sorts,
including those that require <a href="pubs/2003-05-05-LCTES03-CodeSafety.html">
extensive interprocedural analysis</a>.  LLVM is also a great target for <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org/">front-end development</a> for conventional or research
programming languages, including those which require <a
href="pubs/2004-01-30-CGO-LLVM.html">compile-time, link-time, or run-time
optimization</a> for effective implementation, proper tail calls or garbage
collection.  We have an incomplete <a
href="ProjectsWithLLVM/">list of projects</a> which have used LLVM for various
purposes, showing that you can get up-and-running quickly with LLVM, giving time
to do interesting things, even if you only have a semester in a University
course.  We also have a list of <a href="OpenProjects.html">ideas for 
projects</a> in LLVM.</p>
