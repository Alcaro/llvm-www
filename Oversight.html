<div class="www_sectiontitle">LLVM Oversight Group Mission</div>
<div class="www_text">
  <p>The LLVM Oversight Group is a small group of LLVM developers that aim to
  guide continued development, distribution, and community-building for
  LLVM.  Our broad aim is to foster the wider adoption and growth of LLVM.
  A key part of that is to encourage participation and contributions from
  both UIUC and non-UIUC users.</p>

  <p>We do <b>not</b> aim to create a bureaucracy.  On the contrary, we believe
  that having a simple but organized process for overseeing LLVM should give
  more confidence to potential users and contributors in the stability and
  longevity of LLVM, and therefore encourage them to get involved.  Having a
  well-understood process for major contributions should also encourage
  developers to contribute their work and stay involved.</p>
</div>
    
<div class="www_subsection">Membership and Communication</div>
<div class="www_text">
  <p>The oversight group currently consists of Chris Lattner, Vikram Adve, Reid
  Spencer and Misha Brukman. Our goal for the membership of this group is to
  have Chris, Vikram and two or three other active LLVM developers,
  including at least one from academia and one from industry.</p>

  <p>You can send e-mail to the group at
  <a href="mailto:oversight@llvm.org">
    <b><tt>oversight@llvm.org</tt></b></a>.  This alias only reaches 
  the oversight group, and messages can be kept confidential on request.  
  Please use this alias for any feedback or suggestions regarding LLVM 
  policy issues outlined in the mission statement below (rather than 
  broadcasting them to <tt>llvmdev</tt>).

<div class="www_subsection">Mission</div>
<div class="www_text">
<p>The primary goals of the LLVM oversight group are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Functionality and Stability in the Core Framework:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Adjudicate substantial changes to the core LLVM components,
	which essentially includes everything in <tt>llvm/lib/</tt>
	and the key llvm tools.</li>
	<li>Identify and prioritize improvements to the core.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Guidelines for who gets write-access to SVN:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The goal here is to encourage the most active contributors by
	giving them direct SVN write access.</li>
	<li> Our primary guiding principle here is that write access should
	be limited to persons who have a track record of responsible
	contributions, and are likely to remain active contributors
	for a long time (not for short-term projects).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Public Awareness:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Be <i>proactive</i> in finding opportunities to attract users
	and developers.</li>
	<li>Give/organize LLVM tutorials at conferences.</li>
	<li>Create publicity for new releases.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Licensing and Copyright:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Oversee changes in LLVM licensing.</li>
	<li>Oversee LLVM copyright ownership issues.</li>
	<li>Attempt to ensure that we don't violate copyrights of other
	software used by or in LLVM, or infringe patents, especially
	unintentional violations due to contributed code.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Release Management:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Collect feedback on what users would like to see in future releases.</li>
	<li>Provide a "best guess" page on what will be in the next release.</li>
	<li>Manage quarterly releases.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Open Projects and Ongoing Projects:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Identify projects we would like to see happen.</li>
	<li>Maintain public information about these projects and priorities
	to guide interested developers.</li>
	<li>Maintain public information about ongoing major projects to
	avoid redundancy (and minimize a major source of conflict!).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Dispute Resolution:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Resolve TECHNICAL disputes between parties that are unable
	to resolve the issues themselves.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
