<div class="www_sectiontitle">LLVM Foundation Board of Directors Application</div>
<p>
This is an application to serve as a board member on the LLVM Foundation Board of Directors. The LLVM Foundation is a nonprofit that supports the LLVM Project. We support the LLVM community by helping it to grow, foster community interactions, work to keep LLVM development productive through infrastructure, and work to ensure the long term health of the LLVM project. 
</p><p>
The LLVM Foundation has established 3 main programs to help us in our community growth and education efforts: Educational Outreach (LLVM Developers’ Meetings, documentation, workshops, instructional videos), Scholarships & Grants, and Women in Compilers & Tools. We host much of the infrastructure (website, mailing lists, etc) supporting the LLVM Project.  Please read our public documents for more information, available <a href="http://llvm.org/foundation/documents/">here.</a>
</p><p>
The Board of Directors consists of 8 members serving 2 year terms, which then elect the next set of board members. In terms of time commitment, the board typically meets every month for 2 hours and every board member should plan on attending each meeting. At times a board member will take lead on a particular issue, doing the background research needed, forming a proposal, bringing to the Board for productive discussion and vote. Board members are expected to monitor the board mail lists to address time critical issues or continue discussions between board meetings. Board members should plan on attending at least EuroLLVM or the LLVM Dev Meeting. In addition to the regular meeting, board members are encouraged to participate with and drive efforts aligned with the mission and three programs above. Officers of the Board (Secretary, Treasurer, President) have additional duties and time commitments.
</p><p>
We are looking for people who are passionate and enthusiastic about LLVM and its various sub-projects, and want to help it grow.  Note, however, that the LLVM Foundation does not set the technical direction for the project.  As such, we are particularly interested in people who will bring non-technical contributions to the board, particularly if they align with the mission and three programs mentioned above or improvements to the LLVM infrastructure.
</p><p>
In order to improve transparency and capture the credentials of the newly elected board, the applications of the newly elected board members will be made public once board membership is finalized. The new board will begin their term on August 12, 2016.
</p><p>
